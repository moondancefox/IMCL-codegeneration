Model-driven code generation technology has been widely used in system design. Most of the current mainstream model development is code generation for a single platform. 
However, for heterogeneous systems, due to its multi-platform nature, it is often difficult to design a system using a single model-driven approach. 
Therefore, we propose a code generation approach that can be used from a single model language to a variety of different target platforms. 
By analyzing the syntax tree of the IMCL model, a variety of platform codes, including FPGAs, PLCs, and PCs, are generated under given target language conversion rules. 
Our research can improve the flexibility and practicality of model development. 
It can help developers focus on the logical design of the system and improve the efficiency of developers.
