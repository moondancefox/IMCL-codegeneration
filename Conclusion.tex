\section{Conclusion}
Model-driven code generation techniques have been widely used in system design. For heterogeneous systems, due to their multi-platform nature, it is often difficult to design a system using a single model-driven approach. Therefore, we propose a code generation method that can be used from a single model language to a variety of different target platforms. In this paper, we introduce IMCL features and modeling methods. We have given an approach to converting code from IMCL to the corresponding platform. In this article, we introduce the functional equivalence between the IMCL model and FPGA, PLC, and PC systems. Focused, we have given the rules for conversion between languages. On this basis, by analyzing the syntax tree of the IMCL model, under the given target language conversion rules, we can generate the framework code of the three types of platforms. Our research can improve the flexibility and practicality of model development, allowing developers to put time and energy into the logical design of the system and improve the efficiency of developers.
