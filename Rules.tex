\section{Rules}
The IMCL model has features such as event triggering, message communication, and resource scheduling. This section describes the conversion rules for converting IMCL models into PLC programs from the perspective of code generation. Common techniques for code generation are based on ASTs, and so are ours. The abstract syntax tree is also called the AST syntax tree, which is the tree structure corresponding to the source code syntax. That is, for source code in a specific programming language, statements in the source code are mapped to each node in the tree by constructing a syntax tree. In the tree structure on the basis of IMCL, given by the code generation rules, the model may be implemented to generate the code for the target platform.
